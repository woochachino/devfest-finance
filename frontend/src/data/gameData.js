                    content: "ARK Invest's Cathie Wood has been steadily selling NVIDIA shares, reducing exposure by over 50%. Wood argues NVIDIA is 'priced for perfection' and prefers 'pure AI software plays.' She's rotating into Roku, Teladoc, and other beaten-down names. 'Hardware is commoditizing. Software will capture the long-term value,' Wood claims. Skeptics note ARKK underperformed the Nasdaq by 40% in 2023.",
